# Odin_Final
This is an attempt to complete the "Landing Page" section of the online course set by The Odin Project. I'll be using this readme file as an outline and reminder for what I need to do for this project, and to get it to a satisfactory level. I will then leave a self criticism at the end for myself to later review down the line.

I'll have to build the html boilerplate
Fill in any details that were asked to be provided sourced from the project page
Ensure all my elements are respectively classed and labled
Build and fill out a css sheet
